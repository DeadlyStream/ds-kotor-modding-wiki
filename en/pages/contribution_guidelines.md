The purpose of this wiki is to provide a centralised store of knowledge covering all facets of modding Knights of the Old Republic, with a focus on providing clear, unambiguous information easily digestible by those unfamiliar with the Odyssey engine, or modding in general. 

Those interested in contributing should consider [Wikipedia's Five Pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars) as a good set of general principles to adhere to.

Whilst direct editing of the Wiki requires a Github account, those who wish to contribute without one may submit content in an alternative form (e.g. Word Doc) via Deadly Stream or Discord and have it added on their behalf.
